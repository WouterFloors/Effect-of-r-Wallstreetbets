## 1.1. Motivation

### Motivation for data context

r/Wallstreetbets is a community within Reddit that discusses stocks and options and includes roughly 11 million members. WallStreetBets has had a huge influence on the stock market such as Gamestop and AMC.
By analyzing the sentiment scores of a stock in a given time period while taking the market  cap and volume of the stock into account, the relative influence of the community on stock prices can be assessed. 
With this data, researchers can study the impact of WSB on the stock market. For example: do certain posts or flairs affect certain stocks? Do prices go up or down due to certain comments? Furthermore, the data can be combined with different APIâ€™s such as Reddit, Twitter and Yahoo Finance.

### Motivation for choice of website/API

The data sources are publicly available.Primary data provided by WallStreetBets (data mainly provided through the API, rather than website). Data also available (partly) on Github.
Secondary data (stock prices, market cap, volume etc.) provided by Yahoo Finance
